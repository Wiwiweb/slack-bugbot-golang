# slack-bugbot-golang
A Simple Slack bot created to practice golang.

This started as a personal project that would only post bug links when someone posted a bug number, for convenience. However it grew in size and more features were requested from colleagues.

The main repository was moved to the work organisation so that I could continue working on it during work time. As such, this repository is now archived and inactive.
